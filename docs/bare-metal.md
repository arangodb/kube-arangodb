# ArangoDB on bare metal Kubernetes

A note of warning for lack of a better word upfront: Kubernetes is
awesome and powerful. As with awesome and powerful things, there is
infinite ways of setting up a k8s cluster. With great flexibility
comes great complexity. There are infinite ways of hitting barriers.

This guide is a walk through for, again in lack of a better word,
a reasonable and flexible setup to get to an ArangoDB cluster setup on
a bare metal kubernetes setup.

## BEWARE: Do not use this setup for production!

This guide does not involve setting up dedicated master nodes or high
availability for Kubernetes, but uses for sake of simplicity a single untainted
master. This is the very definition of a test environment.

If you are interested in running a high available Kubernetes setup, please
refer to: [Creating Highly Available Clusters with kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/high-availability/)

## Requirements

Let there be 3 Linux boxes, `kube01 (192.168.10.61)`, `kube02 (192.168.10.62)`
and `kube03 (192.168.10.3)`, with `kubeadm` and `kubectl` installed and off we go:

* `kubeadm`, `kubectl` version `>=1.10` 

## Initialize the master node

The master node is outstanding in that it handles the API server and some other
vital infrastructure

```
sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```

```

  Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

  To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

    mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
    sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
    sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

  You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
  Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

  You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node as root:

  kubeadm join 192.168.10.61:6443 --token blcr1y.49wloegyaugice8a --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:0505933664d28054a62298c68dc91e9b2b5cf01ecfa2228f3c8fa2412b7a78c8
```

Go ahead and do as above instructed and see into getting kubectl to work on the master:

```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

## Deploy a pod network

For this guide, we go with **flannel**, as it is an easy way of setting up a
layer 3 network, which uses the Kubernetes API and just works anywhere, where a
network between the involved machines works:

```
kubectl apply -f \
	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/bc79dd1505b0c8681ece4de4c0d86c5cd2643275/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```
```
  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/flannel created
  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/flannel created
  serviceaccount/flannel created
  configmap/kube-flannel-cfg created
  daemonset.extensions/kube-flannel-ds-amd64 created

  daemonset.extensions/kube-flannel-ds-arm created
  daemonset.extensions/kube-flannel-ds-ppc64le created
  daemonset.extensions/kube-flannel-ds-s390x created
```

## Join remaining nodes

Run the above join commands on the nodes `kube02` and `kube03`. Below is the
output on `kube02` for the setup for this guide:

```
sudo kubeadm join 192.168.10.61:6443 --token blcr1y.49wloegyaugice8a --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:0505933664d28054a62298c68dc91e9b2b5cf01ecfa2228f3c8fa2412b7a78c8
```
```
  [preflight] Running pre-flight checks

  [discovery] Successfully established connection with API Server "192.168.10.61:6443"
  [join] Reading configuration from the cluster...
  [join] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -oyaml'
  [kubelet] Downloading configuration for the kubelet from the "kubelet-config-1.13" ConfigMap in the kube-system namespace

  [tlsbootstrap] Waiting for the kubelet to perform the TLS Bootstrap...
  [patchnode] Uploading the CRI Socket information "/var/run/dockershim.sock" to the Node API object "kube02" as an annotation

This node has joined the cluster:
* Certificate signing request was sent to apiserver and a response was received.
* The Kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on the master to see this node join the cluster.
```

## Untaint master node

```
kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-
```
```
  node/kube01 untainted
  taint "node-role.kubernetes.io/master:" not found
  taint "node-role.kubernetes.io/master:" not found
```

## Wait for nodes to get ready and sanity checking

After some brief period, you should see that your nodes are good to go:

```
kubectl get nodes
```
```
  NAME     STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
  kube01   Ready    master   38m   v1.13.2
  kube02   Ready    <none>   13m   v1.13.2
  kube03   Ready    <none>   63s   v1.13.2
```

Just a quick sanity check to see, that your cluster is up and running:

```
kubectl get all --all-namespaces
```
```
  NAMESPACE     NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

  Your release is named 'sad-newt'.

  You can now deploy an ArangoLocalStorage resource.

  See https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/deployment-kubernetes-storage-resource.html
  for further instructions.

```
## Deploy ArangoDB cluster

- Deploy local storage

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arangodb/kube-arangodb/master/examples/arango-local-storage.yaml
```
```  
  arangolocalstorage.storage.arangodb.com/arangodb-local-storage created
``` 

- Deploy simple cluster

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arangodb/kube-arangodb/master/examples/simple-cluster.yaml
```
```
  arangodeployment.database.arangodb.com/example-simple-cluster created
```

## Access your cluster

- Find your cluster's network address:

```
kubectl get services
```
```
  NAME                                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
  arango-deployment-operator               ClusterIP   10.104.189.81   <none>        8528/TCP         14m
  arango-deployment-replication-operator   ClusterIP   10.107.2.133    <none>        8528/TCP         14m
  example-simple-cluster                   ClusterIP   10.109.170.64   <none>        8529/TCP         5m18s
  example-simple-cluster-ea                NodePort    10.98.198.7     <none>        8529:30551/TCP   4m8s
  example-simple-cluster-int               ClusterIP   None            <none>        8529/TCP         5m19s
  kubernetes                               ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          69m
```

- In this case, according to the access service, `example-simple-cluster-ea`,
  the cluster's coordinators are reachable here:

https://kube01:30551, https://kube02:30551 and https://kube03:30551

## LoadBalancing

For this guide we like to use the `metallb` load balancer, which can be easiy
installed as a simple layer 2 load balancer:

- install the `metalllb` controller: 

```
kubectl apply -f \
	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/metallb/v0.7.3/manifests/metallb.yaml
```
```
  namespace/metallb-system created
  serviceaccount/controller created
  serviceaccount/speaker created
  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metallb-system:controller created
  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metallb-system:speaker created
  role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/config-watcher created
  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metallb-system:controller created
  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metallb-system:speaker created
  rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/config-watcher created
  daemonset.apps/speaker created
  deployment.apps/controller created
```

- Deploy network range configurator. Assuming that the range for the IP addresses,
  which are granted to `metalllb` for load balancing is 192.168.10.224/28,
  download the [exmample layer2 configurator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/metallb/v0.7.3/manifests/example-layer2-config.yaml).

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/metallb/v0.7.3/manifests/example-layer2-config.yaml
```

- Edit the `example-layer2-config.yaml` file to use the according addresses.
  Do this with great care, as YAML files are indention sensitive.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap

  namespace: metallb-system
